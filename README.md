# Gaussian 16 Utilities

This repository contains utilities for Gaussian16
 
1) Python script designed to generate Gaussian input files from SMILES strings. It processes Excel files containing molecule names (in the first column) and SMILES strings (in the second column) to create Gaussian input files.

2) Python script designed to generate Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) plots directly from .out or .log files. The images are generated in high quality for publication.

Smiles to G16 input file generator 

**Note:** Ensure the Excel file's first row contains the headers "name" and "smiles", as the script filters data based on these keywords.
Check an excel example [here](https://github.com/MartFrancisco/G16-Utilities/blob/main/molecules.xlsx)
Check an input generated by the code [here](https://github.com/MartFrancisco/G16-Utilities/blob/main/Bod.com)

The script also supports TXT files; however, no headers are included. In this case, the molecule name and its SMILES must be separated by a whitespace.

## Features

The script allows you to customize memory allocation, number of cores, checkpoint file settings, and theory level. These options can be easily adjusted through flags when running the script.

### Default Settings:
- **Memory:** `32 GB` (modifiable with `--mem`)
- **Cores:** `32` (modifiable with `--proc`)
- **Theory level:** `Ï‰b97xd/def2svp` (modifiable with `--level`)
- **Charge:** `0` (modifiable with `--charge`)
- **Multiplicity:** `1` (modifiable with `--mult`)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

The easiest way to set up these scripts is to clone the repository directly from GitHub. Follow these steps:

1. Load Git on the CHPC (Center for High Performance Computing) environment:
    ```bash
    module load git
    ```

2. Clone the repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:MartFrancisco/G16-Utilities.git
    ```

3. Move the Python script to your `~/bin/` directory:
    ```bash
    mv smiles_to_gaussian.py ~/bin/
    ```

4. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod u+x ~/bin/smiles_to_gaussian.py
    ```

## Requirements

Before using the script, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **openpyxl**: For reading Excel files.
- **Open Babel**: For converting chemical file formats.

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

OpenBabel instalation depends on the operating system:

1) For Ubunto/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install openbabel
```
2) For macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install open-babel
```
3) Windows - You need to dowload directly from OpenBabel website

## Usage

### Generating Gaussian Input Files

The script `smiles_to_gaussian.py` reads an Excel file with molecule names and SMILES strings and generates Gaussian input files (.com).

#### Running the Script

1. To run the script with default settings:
    ```bash
    python ~/bin/smiles_to_gaussian.py file_name.xlsx
    ```

2. To modify settings such as memory, cores, theory level, charge, or multiplicity, use flags:
    ```bash
    python ~/bin/smiles_to_gaussian.py file_name.xlsx --mem 64 --proc 64 --level "wb97xd/6-31+g(d,p)" --charge 1 --mult 2
    ```

Generate high-quality IRC (Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate) energy profile plots
from Gaussian output files (.out or .log).

Features:
- Parses Gaussian IRC tables and transition state energy
- Converts energies to kcal/mol
- Re-references energies to the first IRC point
- Optional smoothing with spline interpolation
- Customizable fonts and font sizes for axes, legend/title, and ticks
- Saves plots in tiff, jpeg, or jpg formats
- Output filename automatically matches the input file stem

Usage:
    python irc_plot.py irc_s0_f_oqm.out --axis_font "Arial" --axis_font_size 16 \
        --legend_font "Arial" --legend_font_size 16 --tick_font_size 14 \
        --smooth 0.2 --output_format tiff
